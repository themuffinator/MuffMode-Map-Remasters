Description:		It's been sitting on my hard drive for about 2 years cos it was only a piss about map,                              please dont take it seriously. This map should have really been ven_dm1 as its was the                              first map i ever made. I thought i may aswell release it and see what people think of it,                           its better than just gathering dust on my HD for another 2 years. Its very heavy on the                             r_speeds so you need a pretty good pc to be able to run it but if you got the processor                             power its a great laugh and superb practise for your rail eye.

	- INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS -

  Extract the whole mess to x:\ where "x" is the drive you have Quake2
installed. In most cases this, this would be your "C" drive. Don't worry,
it'll unzip all the files to their proper locations. 

or...just extract it to a temp directory and drag the bits into the right folders in your q2 directory.

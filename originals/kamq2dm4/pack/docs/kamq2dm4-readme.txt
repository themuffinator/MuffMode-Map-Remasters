* Installation & Running *

Technically you should know how to do this, but just in case you don't:

    - Slap the BSP into your /quake2/baseq2/maps directory
    - Run Quake2 using either the command line "quake2.exe +map kamq2dm4.bsp"
        -OR-
    - Pull down the console in the game and type "map kamq2dm4" w/o quotes.

Whoever is in charge of uploads here (Mr. Schuur?), could you please replace the old browdm1 files with these two, I've fixed a couple of things in the map.
Thanks,
Brow

Map description :

A small 1 on 1 map; don't try it with more. It's made with bots highly in mind, hence no difficult buttons, lava, etc. The eraser route file also helps :) There are lots of large, high rooms, good for dueling in, IMHO. This map was inspired by DM6 (Classic Quake), although there isn't too much similarity. There is one hint I can give you here: the elevator by the ammo pack isn't exactly one-way.

A few words :

I'd downloaded dozens of DM maps, but only a few are really good for 1 v 1 (the only way to truly DM :), so I made this. It's my first map, so it's not great, but I like it. I would love as much feedback and criticism as I can get. I really want to know what you thought of it, and maybe even how it could be improved (if you have the time). There are places that could be improved, but I've spent enough time tweaking it as it is, especially since this is only my first level. BTW, the level's name is both a refernce to the slightly confusing corridors in the central room and my mental state while making the map.

* Construction *

Base                    : From scratch
Editors used            : BSP 0.93, EditPad (to help convert from Q1), QERadiant (very briefly)
Known Bugs              : None
Build Time              : 2 weeks of actual work over a 2-3 month span
Texture WALs used       : E3U1
Compile machine         : P2-233, 96 MB RAM, Riva 128
BSP Size                : 470 brushes
QBSP3 time		: 8 s

Comparing those compile times to other mappers', I'm really glad I enjoy 1 v 1 over FFA (or -- gasp! -- SPQ) :)

And yes, vis was done with -level 4, and radiosity with -extra and -bounce 40.

* How to play this level (don't laugh, there's always a first time) *

1. Unzip browdm1.zip (includes this .txt and browdm1.bsp) into the "baseq2/maps" directory under your Quake2 directory (make that directory if you have to).

2. Run a Quake 2 DM game as usual, go to the console (` key) and enter "map brow2dm1" without quotes. Of course, it'll be kinda boring unless someone joins you in there, but I'll leave that to you.

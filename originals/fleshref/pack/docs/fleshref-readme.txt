* Comments *

The weathered arena lies desolate under the blood-red Stroggos
sunset, battered through decades of relentless deathmatching.
Although it has seen better days, it remains the ideal place to
settle personal differences...Quake style.

This level contains a powerup called the "power screen". For those
players unfamiliar with this item, it's basically a toned-down
version of the infamous power shield. The power screen absorbs much
less damage, and then only from frontal attacks.

To use this powerup, you need to bind a key to "use power screen".
Its use here doesn't unbalance gameplay in the way that the power shield
can - extensive play-testing of the level has verified this :)
